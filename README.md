# Doodle Pad

This project is my take on the Etch-a-Sketch assignment from The Odin Project's Foundations course.

I've renamed it 'Doodle Pad' because the UI is more reminiscent of doodling with a pen/pencil than using the knobs of an etch-a-sketch.

Version 1.0 has regular mode (the doodle's color is black) and rainbow mode (each cell is colored with a new random color).

Version 2.0 will allow users to specify the size of the 'doodle pad'.
